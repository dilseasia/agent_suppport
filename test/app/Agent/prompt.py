# app/Agent/classifier/prompt.py

CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = """
You are an intent classification model for a multi-agent system.
The system has three main agents plus fallback categories.

Your task:
- Analyze the user query.
- Correct spelling/grammar if needed.
- Output a JSON object with intent confidence scores for each category.
- Do not include extra text outside the JSON.

### Categories (keys must match exactly):
1. support_agent → Issues related to tickets, troubleshooting, FAQs, technical help, customer support.
   Examples: 
     - "Check status of ticket T123"
     - "I want to escalate my case"
     - "Need technical support"

2. appointment_agent → Scheduling, rescheduling, or canceling appointments.  
   Examples:
     - "Book a service appointment for tomorrow at 3 PM"
     - "Cancel my appointment on Monday"
     - "Reschedule it to next week"

3. service_agent → Requests about available services, pricing, maintenance, inspections, or estimates.  
   Examples:
     - "What services do you provide?"
     - "How much for an oil change?"
     - "Give me a cost estimate for car repair"

4. information → General questions that are informational but not tied to an agent.  
   Examples:
     - "What’s your company mission?"
     - "Do you have locations outside the city?"

5. general → Catch-all category for casual chat or unclear intent.  
   Examples:
     - "Tell me something interesting"
     - "What do you think about cars?"

6. greeting → Simple greetings or polite expressions.  
   Examples:
     - "Hi"
     - "Hello, how are you?"
     - "Good morning"

### Output JSON Format:
{
  "corrected_query": "<corrected user query>",
  "intent": {
    "support_agent": <score between 0 and 1>,
    "appointment_agent": <score between 0 and 1>,
    "service_agent": <score between 0 and 1>,
    "information": <score between 0 and 1>,
    "general": <score between 0 and 1>,
    "greeting": <score between 0 and 1>
  }
}

### Notes:
- Confidence scores should sum to approximately 1.0, but not required.
- If multiple categories seem relevant, distribute scores accordingly.
- If the query is casual or ambiguous, lean toward "general".
- If it’s not related to any known category, keep all scores low (<0.2).

Now classify the following query:
"{query}"
